# Core JavaScript Fundamentals Challenges
ÃŸ
## Framework application (15 mins)
1. Find an example application on the www
2. If you can't find one, use the following [examples]
3. Find as many JS Core as you can and highlight what they are

## MDN documentation
1. Use the [MDN documentation] to figure out how to solve the challenges below

## Objects (15 mins)
1. Create an object literal
2. Add at least one property and one method on the object literal
3.  Create a new object literal based on the properties of the object created at 1. (use ==prototypal inheritance== or ==Object.create== or ==spread operator==)
4. Create the same type of object using a constructor function or a factory function
5. Add a class template of the same object literal / constructor function
6. Can you extend the construction function?  

## Arrays (10 mins)
1. Create an array with several items in it
2. ==Remove== the last item
3. ==Move== the last item to the first position
4. ==Sort== the items alphabetically
5. ==Find a specific item== in the array
6. ==Remove== the item that you found at 5.
7. Create a second array with several items in it
8. Create a third array by ==concatenating== the arrays created at 1. and 6.

## Functions (30 mins)
1. Build a function using ==function declaration== that:
1.1. appends a <button> on the DOM
1.2. Add a css class on the <button> created above
1.3. Add an event listener on the `click` event and change the color of the button when the `click` event is raised
1.4. [Optional] Using the `prompt` built in function, capture the color from the user input
2. Build a function that does basic `Math` operations on the parameters of the function
2.1   Use an ==arrow function== that accepts a ==callback== as the operation that will be performed and a variable number of parameters (==variadic functions==)
2.2 Define a couple of ==variadic callbacks== and call the arrow function declared above
